\f0\fs24 \cf0 I enjoy using programming to process. analyze, and identify pattens in large amounts of data, and Python is typically preferred for these tasks due to its extensive statistical libraries and ease of use. Machine learning and statistical analysis typically require array manipulation. I wish Java was able to easily perform some of the array manipulation available natively in Python and within the NumPy package to help with design decisions around array sizing and error handling. Vectors within arrays can be much more easily isolated iand arrays can more efficiently be resized or reshaped in Python. This change would allow machine learning programs to capitalize on the speed and platform independence of Java.}
